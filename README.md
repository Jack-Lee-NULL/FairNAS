# FairNAS
FairNAS, proposed by XiaoMi nas group, is a neural architecture search algorithm.

It is proposed to solve three problems:

**a)** Why is there a large gap between the range of supernet predicted accuracies and that of
ground truth ones by stand-alone training from scratch?

**b)** How to builded a good evaluator that neighter overestimates nor underestimates subnetworks?

**c)** Why does the weight-sharing mechanism work, if under some conditions?
